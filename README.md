# DoogalBot

A GroupMe chat bot dedicated to reading in messages and responding with quotes from Doogal, the main character of the 2005 film 'Doogal'.

The bot reads in messages from the chat that it is placed into and searches for its keyword, which is '!doogal'. If it finds its keyword, it will trigger and pick a random string from the array of strings that has been provided (Every time Doogal speaks in the Doogal movie) and send it to the chat. If it does not find its keyword, it will try to trigger from the random number generator, which gives it a 1 in 100 chance of triggering on a random message and sending a random string to the chat from the same list.
